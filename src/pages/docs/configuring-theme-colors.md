Alto has a flexible color palette in both light and dark modes, which can also apply to the embedded Pagefind search tool.

## Changing theme colors

Navigate to **Site Settings &gt; Theme Palette**, and select Light or Dark mode.


Here, you can set hex colors for your text, background, code blocks, buttons, scrollbars, borders, focus, shortcodes, and for Pagefind.
